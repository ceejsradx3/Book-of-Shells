# Book-of-Shells
This is an amalgamation of THINGS :waves hands: I have compiled during my time at Bryan County Schools. Items range from powershell scripts, to GPOs, and even some things used in MDM administration. Please double check the code to make sure it will work for you-making any edits neccesary to suit your needs. Each have at some point been beneficial enough to me to put down into files and structures with the intent to reuse.

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
Please be sure to comb over any code you may be using, and ensure you have modified it to suit your needs. I am not responsible for any errors or diasters that may arise!
