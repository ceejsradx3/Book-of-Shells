# Book-of-Shells
This is an amalgamation of things :waves hands: I have compiled during my time at Bryan County Schools. Items range from powershell scripts, to GPOs, and even some things used in MDM administration that I managed for a bit. Each have at some point been beneficial enough to me to put down into files and structures with the intent to reuse.
