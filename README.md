# Book-of-Shells
This is an amalgamation of scripts I have compiled during my time at Bryan County Schools. These are scripts that helped me during my day to day duties as an administrator for the entire county.


Scripts range from powershell, bash, and maybe even apple script. Please double check the code to make sure it will work for you making any edits neccesary to suit your needs.
